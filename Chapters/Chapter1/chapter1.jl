#A common problem for compilers and text editors is determining whether the
#((())())() contains properly nested pairs of parentheses, which the strings )()( and
#()) do not. Give an algorithm that returns true if a string contains properly nested
#and balanced parentheses, and false if otherwise. For full credit, identify the position
#of the first oï¬€ending parenthesis if the string is not properly nested and balanced.

# This one seems fairly simple: 
# Initita a counter at 0
# Cycle thru the string per character; if its a (, add +1 to the counter
# If its a ), subtract one. If the counter becomes negative , the string is invalid.
